# Nexus - Intelligent Partner Opportunity Management System

## What is Nexus?

Nexus is an intelligent partner opportunity management system that automates the identification, scoring, and routing of high-value partnership opportunities. It serves as a central hub for managing partner-account overlaps, providing real-time insights and automated workflow orchestration to maximize partnership success.

## What Does Nexus Do?

### Core Functionality

**1. Partner Opportunity Intelligence**
- Automatically identifies and scores partnership opportunities based on multiple weighted criteria
- Analyzes partner-account overlaps from Crossbeam data to find strategic collaboration opportunities
- Provides intelligent scoring for both opportunity potential and partner strength
- Flags high-visibility "logo potential" opportunities for executive attention

**2. Automated Workflow Orchestration**
- Routes opportunities through hierarchical escalation paths (Account Executive → Sales Manager → Executive)
- Sends intelligent, context-aware Slack notifications with actionable insights
- Implements configurable delays and escalation logic to ensure proper follow-up
- Tracks resolution status and prevents duplicate processing

**3. Real-Time Pipeline Visualization**
- Displays opportunities in a Kanban-style pipeline view segmented by score ranges (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100)
- Provides visual insights into opportunity distribution and prioritization
- Shows partner-opportunity relationships with combined scoring metrics

**4. Dynamic Scoring & Weighting**
- Configurable scoring weights for opportunity criteria (size, relationship status, engagement, stage, winnability)
- Adjustable partner scoring weights (relationship strength, recent deal support, size, stickiness)
- Real-time score recalculation based on updated weights
- Combined scoring algorithm for overall opportunity prioritization

## How Does Nexus Work?

### Technical Architecture

**Backend (FastAPI + Python)**
- **Data Processing**: Integrates with Crossbeam API to fetch partner-opportunity overlap data
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Uses weighted algorithms to calculate opportunity and partner scores
- **AI-Powered Messaging**: Leverages Google Gemini AI to generate contextual, personalized Slack messages
- **Workflow Engine**: Manages escalation hierarchies and message timing
- **Database Management**: SQLite database for storing scoring weights, team configurations, and overlap status

**Frontend (React + Vite)**
- **Pipeline Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of opportunities across score ranges
- **Weight Management**: Dynamic configuration of scoring criteria weights
- **Team Management**: Internal team member configuration and hierarchy setup
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data refresh and status tracking

### Workflow Process

1. **Data Ingestion**: Nexus continuously monitors Crossbeam for new partner-opportunity overlaps
2. **Intelligent Scoring**: Each overlap is scored using configurable weights for opportunity and partner criteria
3. **Qualification**: The system determines if an overlap meets processing criteria (logo potential, score thresholds)
4. **Message Generation**: AI generates contextual, personalized messages based on hierarchy level and opportunity details
5. **Escalation Routing**: Messages are sent to appropriate team members based on hierarchy and escalation rules
6. **Status Tracking**: Resolution status is tracked to prevent duplicate processing
7. **Pipeline Visualization**: All opportunities are displayed in the interactive dashboard for strategic overview

### AI-Powered Intelligence

**Contextual Message Generation**
- Uses Google Gemini AI to create natural, professional Slack messages
- Incorporates opportunity context, partner details, and hierarchy-specific messaging
- Focuses on actionable insights and strategic recommendations
- Avoids technical jargon while maintaining professional tone

**Smart Escalation Logic**
- Implements configurable delays between escalation levels
- Tracks message delivery and response status
- Prevents spam by managing message frequency
- Ensures proper follow-up through automated reminders

## Key Features

### 1. Pipeline Management
The pipeline management system organizes opportunities by combined score ranges, providing color-coded lanes for quick opportunity assessment. It features real-time updates with live data refresh for current opportunity status, while strategic insights through lane descriptions provide guidance for each score range.

### 2. Team Configuration
- **Hierarchical Setup**: Configurable team structure with escalation paths
- **Channel Management**: Dedicated Slack channels for each team member
- **Webhook Integration**: Secure Slack webhook configuration for message delivery
- **Role-Based Routing**: Messages routed based on hierarchy and responsibility

### 3. Scoring System
- **Dynamic Weights**: Real-time adjustment of scoring criteria importance
- **Dual Scoring**: Separate opportunity and partner scoring algorithms
- **Combined Metrics**: Overall score calculation for prioritization
- **Configurable Criteria**: Flexible scoring parameters for different business needs

### 4. Automation & Intelligence
- **AI Message Generation**: Context-aware, personalized communication
- **Escalation Automation**: Intelligent routing through hierarchy levels
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive overlap resolution monitoring
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart processing to avoid redundant notifications
